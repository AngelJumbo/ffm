# ffm — Fish File Manager

`ffm` is a minimalist, interactive file manager built entirely in [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) (there is a [`bash version`](https://github.com/AngelJumbo/bash_ffm)). It's based on `fzf`, with Vim-style keybindings and colorful file previews powered by `exa` and `bat`.
